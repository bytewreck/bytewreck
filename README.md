## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Valdemar, and I work as a security researcher on the research team at SpecterOps. I have a passion for dissecting software to understand its inner workings as well as an odd habit of optimizing proof-of-concept code for no apparent reason.

I have a background in cybersecurity consulting, with a focus on red teaming / adversary simulation. My experience includes breaking into and helping secure client environments, giving me a well-rounded perspective on offensive and defensive security.
